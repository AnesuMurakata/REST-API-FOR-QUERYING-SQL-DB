# REST-API-FOR-QUERYING-SQL-DB

The above is an implementation of a RESTful API using the Falcon framework. It can perform queries to a database (file.db - SQLite) as well as add entries into the database.
Data stored is from a forum application where users can post messages in a specific group and also upvote or downvote messages thereby requiring the database to support one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.
